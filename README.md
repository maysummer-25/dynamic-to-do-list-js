# Dynamic To-Do List Application 📝

A simple JavaScript-based to-do list application that allows users to add and remove tasks dynamically using advanced DOM manipulation.

- ❌ Remove tasks individually using the **Remove** button next to each task
- 🎯 Clean and user-friendly interface

## 🧪 How It Works

- When the page loads, JavaScript sets up event listeners.

Users can:

  - Type a task into the input box

  - Click the "Add Task" button or press Enter

- A new list item (<li>) is created and added to the task list (<ul>).

- Each task comes with a Remove button which, when clicked, deletes the task from the list
