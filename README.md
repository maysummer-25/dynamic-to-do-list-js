# 📝 To-Do List Application

This is a simple yet functional To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Users can add and remove tasks, and the list is automatically saved in the browser using **Local Storage**, so tasks persist even after refreshing or closing the page.

---

## 📌 Features

- Add new tasks to the list
- Remove completed or unwanted tasks
- Automatically save and load tasks using Local Storage
- Responsive and clean UI

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structure
- **CSS** – for styling
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity and local storage

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use `localStorage` to persist data in the browser
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`)
- Handling user events like `click` and `keypress`
- Using functions to keep code organized and reusable
- Using `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` to store arrays as strings

---

## 🚀 How It Works

  - ### ➕ Adding a Task

- User types a task into the input box and clicks **"Add Task"** or presses **Enter**.
- A new `<li>` is created and displayed on the screen.
- The task is also saved in `localStorage`.

  - ### ❌ Removing a Task

- Clicking the **"Remove"** button deletes the task from the UI.
- The task is also removed from `localStorage`.

  - ### 💾 Saving and Loading Tasks

- On page load, tasks are retrieved from `localStorage` and shown on the screen.
- Every time a task is added or removed, the storage is updated automatically.
